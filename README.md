Installation

python bot.py

The bot will start performing actions based on the mode specified in config.yaml:

Quote Mode: Sends random inspirational quotes.

AI Chat Mode: Fetches the latest message in the channel and responds casually.

Customization

To adjust the AI's tone, modify the gpt_reply function's prompt to fit your desired personality or language style.

You can enable or disable message deletion and reply behavior in config.yaml.

Example config.yaml

  - OTYzMjxxx

CHANNEL_ID:
  - 123456xxxx

Troubleshooting

Invalid Token or Permissions: Ensure the bot token and channel ID are correct. Make sure the bot has permission to send messages in the specified channel.

Rate Limits: The bot might get rate-limited if performing too many actions. Increase the DELAY value if needed.

API Errors: Verify your OpenAI API key and ensure it's active.
